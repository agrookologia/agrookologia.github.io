The aim of this multistakeholder, transdisciplinary and intergenerational network is to connect and strengthen those working with agroecology. The network is meant to be a meeting point, a knowledge-producing and - sharing community and an advocacy organization. The long-term goal is to promote a national and international agroecological transformation of practices and policies and the implementation of food sovereignty through joint work and movement building, and to work together to create a socially, economically and naturally sustainable agricultural production, processing and distribution system in Hungary â€“ and beyond.

 * organize events to promote knowledge sharing and networking, facilitate working relationships and the development of processes between the actors of the Hungarian agroecological transition;
 * carry out agroecological awareness-raising, knowledge sharing and the dissemination of good practices;
 * embed agroecology in the formal and informal education system;
